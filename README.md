This repository contains the official PyTorch implementation of the paper "[Unlocking the Potential of Ordinary Classifier: Class-specific Adversarial Erasing Framework for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation](TBD)" paper (ICCV 2021) by [Hyeokjun Kweon](https://github.com/sangrockEG) and [Sung-Hoon Yoon](https://github.com/sunghoonYoon).

=> We plan to update our github on December, 2021. Sorry for being late.

## Introduction
We have developed a framework that extract the potential of the ordinary classifier with class-specific adversarial erasing framework for weakly supervised semantic segmentation.
With image-level supervision only, we achieved new state-of-the-arts both on PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS-COCO.
